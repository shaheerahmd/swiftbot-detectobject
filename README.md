# SwiftBot - Detect Object

## Overview

The SwiftBot is an autonomous robotics system designed to detect objects and adapt its behavior based on proximity. This project integrates object detection, navigation, and motor control to create a fully autonomous robot capable of making real-time decisions. It uses a combination of sensors and QR code-based control modes to adjust its behavior based on the environment.

## Problem

SwiftBot addresses the need for an adaptive and interactive autonomous robot capable of navigating dynamic environments. The primary challenge was to develop a robot that can detect objects, avoid collisions, and make real-time decisions based on sensor data.

## Approach

The project implements a QR code-based control system with three modes: Curious, Scaredy, and Dubious. The bot detects objects using ultrasonic sensors and adjusts its behavior based on the proximity of objects. The robot's control system is powered by Java and runs on a Raspberry Pi, enabling real-time interaction and decision-making.

## Tech Stack

- **Java**: For control logic and object detection
- **Raspberry Pi**: For hardware interfacing and processing
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: For object detection and proximity sensing
- **QR Code Scanning**: For mode selection and user control
